Hey Guys!!
If any of you guys are having Peer Dependency 
"npm ERR! Conflicting peer dependency: react@17.0.2
npm ERR!   peerOptional react@"^16.14.0 || ^17.0.0" from @reduxjs/toolkit@1.6.1" issue 
, then you have to upgrade your React by going into node modules folder and writing your desired version(17.0.0> due to redux toolkit).

I hope it helps somebody ðŸ˜Š
correct solution
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
